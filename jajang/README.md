# Jajang Sauce Recipe

1) Pork - Sliced into small pieces
2) Cook in pan until crispy

On HIGH Heat, prevent them from getting soggy

1) Onions - Sliced
2) Bae Chu (Cabbage) - Sliced
3) Green Onions - Chopped

4) Jajangmyeon paste
5) Brown Sugar (White Sugar is okay too)

Add some Water

Option: After tasting, can add MSG/Miwon (I don't use this, but placed as an option)

At the end of the tasting, check consistency
- if too loose, add some corn starch 
Corn starch should be first mixed in water, and then add the Corn Starch-Water mixture to the dish

DONE!
